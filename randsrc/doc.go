// Package randsrc provides random number sources based on algorithms like
// Xoroshiro128+, SplitMix64 and Mersenne Twister (MT19937-64).
//
// Things here should be good enough for games and creative coding. Don't use
// them in applications that depend critically on random numbers (criptography,
// for example).
